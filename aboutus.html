      <h2>The Founding of Pacific Trails Resort</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> is a passion project born of the mind of our very own founder Nicole “Bolas” Walker.  
        Fed up with the petty frustrations of corporate life and longing for an authentic rustic camping vacation, she set about fulfilling her 
        vision of the perfect camping getaway, using her years of organizational and management experience to put her plan into action.  
        As Nicole’s sporty nickname implies she leans hard into the athletic and physical aspects of camping, so she contacted her brother Eugene 
        Walker to help her organize our relaxing bird-watching programs, providing balance to let guests unwind after a hard day of hiking, kayaking, and adventuring.  
        Together they have created a paradise tailor-made to exercise the senses dulled by the monotony and artificiality of city and suburban life, and 
        to soothe, relax, and release the tensions and frustrations guests have developed.  For an enriching and unforgettable vacation experience, you can’t do
         better than Pacific Trails Resort.

      <div class="profile-grid-item"><p class="profile-grid-text">Nicole started out her career at Donimaria Ltd., and despite a quick rise through the ranks, she knew something
         felt lacking.  This feeling crystallized when she went on a camping vacation to reflect, where she was galled by the artifice and inauthenticity of the
          camping resort.  She knew what she had to do, and set about creating Pacific Trails Resort.  Nicole’s passions lie in exploring, camping and kayaking.
            She has organized the lion’s share of these programs, and still instructs several.  Be sure to take part in these breathtaking experiences! </p></div>
      <div class="profile-grid-item"><p class="grid-text">Eugene has always been a bird enthusiast, and after difficult life experiences bird-watching became a source of
        relaxation and healing.  His classes focus on the bird-watching as a relaxing exercise to let go of concerns and anxieties.  Eugene has done extensive research on
        local species and has found the best bird-watching routes in the resort.  He personally leads each bird-watching session, so be sure to sign up!</p></div>
